# Birth-Weight-Predictor
Predict Birth Weight Of Your Child

predicts a "newborn baby's birth weight based on maternal health and demographic features".

This end-to-end project allowed me to explore and implement several key concepts in data science and ML engineering:

âœ… Technologies & Concepts Covered:
 1. Python programming
 2. Test-driven development using Pytest
 3. Caching techniques for performance optimization
 4. Hands-on with a Newborn Babies dataset
 5. Full data pipeline: from data understanding to cleaning & preprocessing
 6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including feature engineering & selection
 7. Data splitting: train/test
 8. Model training and prediction using Linear Regression
 9. Model evaluation and result visualization
 10. Built an API using Flask
 11. Model persistence using Pickle
 12. Refactored the codebase using Blueprint architecture and followed clean coding practices
